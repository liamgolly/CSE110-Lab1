## Languages
1. C# - 9/10
   - The best language, at this point it can probably do everything. I have probably been using this language for over 10 years and have completed many projects with it.
  
2. C - 8/10
   - The language that I prefer to turn to when I need extremely optimal code, I have worked with C a lot to make different drivers for various projects and to create optimized math and rendering libraries. 
  
3. Python - 7/10
   - >The second best langauge at everything. - Julie Cover
 
   - A quote from a friend of mine that has been programming python since she was born, I use this language whenever I have to make a small web-based program where I think that the overhead of using another language would outweigh the benefits it would give. I enjoy using python from time to time since it is easy to make small apps due to the simplicity of the language.
  
4. C++ - 5/10
   - Overrated in my opinion, many of the features it adds only seem to add complexity, like the needless complexity of creating and using function pointers:
   ```c++
   void foo(int x, float y, bool z) {}
   // ...
   int (*functionPointer)(int, float, bool) {&foo};
   functionPointer(1, 2.0, false);

   ```
   -  I have only ever used this langauge to create dynamically-linked libraries when I need code to run faster in C# and basic arduino code, so I have little experience with it in other contexts.


5. Java - 4/10
   - While I know some java, I am pretty rusty in it. I have learned java a lot in different classes from high school to college, but I have never seen a real use for it, since C# not only does everything that java can do - from making install wizards to android apps - but C# generally does it with less overhead and better performance.
